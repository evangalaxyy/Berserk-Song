## Tell Me Why

Feel no shame about shape
Weather changes their phrase
Even mother will show you another way
So put your glasses on
Nothing will be wrong
There's no blame, there's no fame
It's up to you
The first words should be found
Whatever hold you back
I can, I can get it off

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late

Have no fear for real
It's just a turning wheel
Once you start up there's no other way
Don't put your eyes on boots
Step forward your roots
There's no aid, there's no trade
It belongs to you

Before you miss something given
You should know what's the truth
I can, I can make it out

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late

Before you miss something given
You should know what's the truth
I can, I can make it out

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late
